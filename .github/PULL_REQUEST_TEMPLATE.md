* Delete this list before clicking CREATE PULL REQUEST
* Make sure you're using a special branch just for this pull request. (Sometimes people unknowingly use a default branch, then later update that branch, which updates the pull request with the other changes if it hasn't been merged yet.)
* Do NOT update the version number in the file. (This just causes conflicts.)
* Do add your name to the list of contributors for that library. (Don't worry about the formatting.) I'll try to remember to add it if you don't, but I sometimes forget as it's an extra step.

If you get something above wrong, don't fret it, it's not the end of the world.
